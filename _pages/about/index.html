I enjoy sitting at the boundary between research and engineering: reading papers in the morning and shipping code in the afternoon.</p> <p>The correct pronunciation of my name is Pah-nah-yo-tah, but you may call me Penny</p> <p><strong>Currently:</strong> based in the Bay Area (Redwood City, CA), open to roles as Senior ML Engineer / Research Scientist / Applied Scientist with a focus on AI security, robust ML, and 3D/Vision models.</p> </body></html>
