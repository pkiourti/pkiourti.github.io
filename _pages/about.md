I’m an ML/CV engineer and researcher interested in making modern AI systems
robust, interpretable, and safe to deploy.

My PhD at Boston University focused on backdoor attacks and defenses in deep
learning, with applications to vision and reinforcement learning.

Most recently, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Carbon, where I built
ML and 3D geometry pipelines for dental applications - automating 3D orientation
and quality checks for 3D printing. I enjoy sitting at the boundary between
research and engineering: reading papers in the morning and shipping code in
the afternoon.

The correct pronunciation of my name is Pah-nah-yo-tah, but you may call me Penny.

**Currently:** based in the Bay Area (Redwood City, CA), open to roles as
Senior ML Engineer / Research Scientist / Applied Scientist with a focus on
AI security, robust ML, and 3D/Vision models.
